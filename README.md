📝 Summary of the Assignment
Overall Approach:
I started by setting up the basic structure of the Angular application. After establishing the core components, I focused on integrating the backend services, ensuring the data is fetched and displayed correctly. Unit and end-to-end tests were added to ensure the application's robustness.

🎉 Implemented Features:
User List View: Displays a list of users with pagination support.
User Detail View: Dive deeper by clicking on a user to view detailed information.
Responsive Design: Designed to be mobile-friendly, adjusting gracefully across different screen sizes.
⏭ Future Improvements and Time Estimates:
Search Functionality: Allow users to search by name. Estimated completion: ~3 hours.
Sort Options: Introduce the ability to sort users based on various criteria like name or recent additions. Estimated time: ~2 hours.
Enhanced Styling and Theming: A facelift with enhanced visual appeal and a potential dark mode. Rough estimate: ~4 hours.
